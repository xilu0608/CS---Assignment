In this project, duplicate product detection is performed with a dataset contains 1624 TV product information from four different Webshops. There are five main steps in this project. They are 
1. Data cleaning 
2. Shingling 
3. Min-hashing
4. Locality-Sensitive Hashing
5. Multi-Component Similarity Method 

The codes for this project is combined with R codes and Python codes. The R codes should be run first for data cleaning. After running the R code, a csv file called "Description 3"is exported. This csv file contains all the essential information for each TV product. The rest part should be performed by Python, which will provide results of each steps mentioned above. At the end, candidate pairs will be shown in the outcome.
